## Ex1 
### Part 1, & 2
to test the flask app, you can run `python3 ex1.py`
, and visit for example: 
```shell
http://localhost:8080/home?difficultyBits=3
```

### Part 3
The answer is `difficulty bits`

## Ex2
I changed the pick_winner function to pick the winner
depending on only the weight. Hence, it would always choose 
account5, and you can check the first 10 blocks by 
running `python3 ex2.py` and wait to check the first 10 new
blocks, I only commented out any prints except for the newly
created blocks
