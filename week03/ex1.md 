# Difference between JavaScript VM and injected Web3

Javascript VM: It will run an isolated ethereum node in the browser. It is very useful when you want to test a contract.

Injected Web3: It will try to use the "Web3 provider" embedded in the browser. For example MetaMask extension will embedd a "Web3 provider",
you can configure to connect that provider to a testnet or to mainnet. This allow to interact with a real network.
